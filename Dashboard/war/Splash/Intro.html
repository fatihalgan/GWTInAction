		Please feel free to play around with the menus, drag and drop capabilities, the various component applications (under the Create menu), internationalization (under Help menu), etc.</br></br>
		Each component application shows off different aspects of GWT, you can find out what those are from the description menu item in the applications menu bar.</br></br>
		There are no real instructions; just click around and play - any comments are welcome on the book's web page (http://www.manning.com/hanson - also available under the bookmark menu).
