The Dashboard shows off aspects of GWT internationalization presenting the interface in three different locales:
<UL>
	<li>English (en)</li>
	<li>Swedish (sv)</li>
	<li>American (en_US) [see the spelling of colour/color in the Help menu]</li>
</UL>
GWT Constants are used for the menu items, and Messages used for the various alert boxes and the name of the Dashboard [top left of screen, which can be edited by you]
<p>
In addition, we have harnessed localization capabilities of GWT to alter the trash icon depending on whether you are in an English (says trash) or Swedish (shows an elk/älg) speaking locale.
<p>
Finally, the Finance News application shows how functionality can be altered depending on the locale (in the Swedish locale a button is presented, in English speaking locales you will only see a Label).
<p>
All this, and more, are taught within the GWT In Action book.
