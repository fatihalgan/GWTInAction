Through the book we look at widgets and panels (seeing how they represent both Java objects and DOM elements), and we show how to 
create new widgets, including:

<UL>
	<li>Two component MenuItem</li>
	<li>Toggle MenuItem</li>
	<li>PNGImage (from the GWT Widget Library)</li>
</UL>

A whole chapter is dedicated to explaining composite widgets and how to build them, including demonstrating the development of the following two composite widgets:

<UL>
	<li>EditableLabel (Flickr like widget in the GWT Widget Library (by the author themselves)</li>
	<li>Sliders</li>
</UL>
With sliders, we finish off by demonstrating the development of the Colour Picker widget in the Dashboard.
