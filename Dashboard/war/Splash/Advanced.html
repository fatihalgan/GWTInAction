GWT is a fantastic technology for delivering AJAX applications as well as offering the
ability to reduce maintenance costs.  However, none of this is achieved without considering 
the developmet lifecycle of applications.
<p>
In GWT In Action we look at a typical lifecycle and follow it through explaining which GWT tool
could be used at which point as well as explaining how the various tools work to get applications
up and running as speedily as possible.
<p>
Once you have worked your way through chapters 2 and 3 you have a full understanding of what the various tools are,
when they are/can be used, the point of them and will have created the first verson of this Dashboard application.
<p>
We cover the tools from projectCreator right through to the web server.
